<h1>{% trans 'Form for playing a card' %}</h1>

{% blocktrans %}
    <p>If you want to play a card, write down the names of your character
    and your card and the names of your partner's character and the card he
    will play on you. Hand out this form and your card to the game master.
    The game master doesn't inform the partner about this. He plays all
    cards only if both partners hand out compatible forms and cards. If you
    want to play a negative card, you don't need to use this form. Just
    hand out the card to the game master directly.</p>
